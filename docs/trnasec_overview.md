# üß¨ tRNA-Sec Overview

## Introduction
Traditionally, cellular *RNA molecules* were classified into three main categories: *messenger RNAs* (*mRNAs*), *ribosomal RNAs* (*rRNAs*), and *transfer RNAs* (*tRNAs*), which are involved in *protein synthesis*. However, with the advent of *high-throughput sequencing technologies*, the existence of numerous additional classes of RNA with *regulatory functions* that transcend these classic roles was revealed [1].

In this context, *non-coding RNAs* (*ncRNAs*)‚Äîmolecules that are *not translated into proteins*‚Äîwere found to be *ubiquitous* and surprisingly *abundant*, representing approximately four times more transcripts than *mRNAs* in human cells [2,3]. Despite their widespread presence, their functions in mammals remain *largely uncharacterized* [1,3].

*ncRNAs* can be classified as *structural* and *regulatory* (Figure 1) [4]. *Structural ncRNAs* include *tRNA* and *rRNA*, as described above. *Regulatory ncRNAs*, on the other hand, are subdivided according to their length into two categories: *small non-coding RNAs* (*sncRNAs*), which are molecules of *up to 200 nucleotides* and include the classes *siRNAs* (*small interfering RNAs*), *miRNAs* (*microRNAs*), *piRNAs* (*PIWI-interacting RNAs*), and *snoRNAs* (*small nucleolar RNAs*), which perform *essential functions* in biological processes such as *translation inhibition* or *metabolic modulation*; and *long non-coding RNAs* (*lncRNAs*), which are *longer than 200 nucleotides* and comprise the *majority of nuclear ncRNAs*.

## tRNAs: canonical and non-canonical functions and structure

Within the category of *sncRNAs*, *tRNAs* constitute a classic group. Discovered more than 60 years ago, their structural study was key to understanding the mechanisms of *translation*. Their canonical function is to act as *essential adapter molecules* in *protein synthesis*, facilitating *mRNA decoding* and *polypeptide assembly* in ribosomes. However, they also perform *non-canonical functions*, participating in processes such as *cell signaling*, *cell survival*, *apoptosis*, *amino acid* and *porphyrin metabolism*, and *stress response programs*.

In terms of their structure, *tRNAs* have:
‚Ä¢ A secondary *‚Äúcloverleaf‚Äù structure* with five main domains: the *acceptor stem* (*CCA end*), the *D arm* (*dihydrouridine loop*), the *T arm* (*TŒ®C loop*), the *anticodon loop*, and the *variable loop*.
‚Ä¢ An *‚ÄúL-shaped‚Äù tertiary structure*, resulting from the three-dimensional folding of these domains.
‚Ä¢ An average size of *70 to 90 nucleotides*, although some are larger; for example, *tRNASec*, with *90 to 101 nucleotides*, is the longest known *tRNA*.

*tRNAs* are also the *RNA molecules with the highest density of post-transcriptional modifications*. Of the more than 170 chemical modifications described in *RNA*, about *100 are found in tRNAs*, with an average of *13 per molecule in eukaryotes* and about *8 in bacteria*. These modifications, located mainly in the *anticodon loop* and in the body of the *tRNA*, constitute a true *‚Äúepitranscriptomic code‚Äù* that modulates the *efficiency* and *plasticity of translation* [5]. Many are introduced by highly conserved specific enzymes (*writers*), and Figure 2 shows a representative diagram of the modified positions in human cytoplasmic *tRNAs* and the enzymes that generate them [6].

## tRNA-derived Fragments

*tRNAs* are a significant source of small *ncRNAs* called *tRNA-derived fragments* (*tsRNAs*) [1]. These are *not random degradation byproducts*, but rather originate from the action of *specific nucleases* on *precursor* or *mature tRNAs* under conditions of *stress*, *infection*, or *tumorigenesis*. *TsRNAs* are divided into two major subtypes: *tRNA halves* or *tiRNAs* (*30‚Äì40 nt*), generated mainly by cleavage in the *anticodon region*, and *tRNA-derived fragments* (*tRFs*), which are *shorter* (*18‚Äì30 nt*) and include five classes: *tRF-5s*, derived from the *5' end* of *mature tRNA*; *tRF-3s*, with the *CCA motif* at the *3' end*; *tRF-1s*, which come from the *trailer sequence* of *pre-tRNA*; *tRF-2s*, which cover the *central region of the anticodon*; and *i-tRFs*, which include segments of the *anticodon loop* together with regions of the *D* and *T loops* [1,3].

Functionally, *tsRNAs* regulate key processes such as *translation inhibition*, *ribosome biogenesis*, and *epigenetic modulation*. Their *dysregulation* is closely associated with *human diseases*, especially *cancer*, where they are being investigated as *biomarkers* for *diagnosis* and *prognosis* [7]. In addition, *post-transcriptional modifications* in *tRNAs* directly influence the *biogenesis* and *function* of these fragments.

## The Special Case of tRNA-Sec

*tRNASec* is an exception within the *tRNA* repertoire because it has a unique architecture and incorporates a non-standard amino acid, *selenocysteine* (*Sec*), which is considered the *21st amino acid* [8‚Äì10].

### *Biosynthesis of Selenocysteine*

Unlike the 20 standard amino acids, which have their own specific synthetases, the biosynthesis of *Sec* occurs directly on *tRNASec* in a multi-step process [11]. The molecule is first aminoacylated with *serine* by *seryl-tRNA synthetase* (*SerRS*). In eukaryotes and archaea, serine is then phosphorylated to *O-phosphoserine* by *O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase* (*PSTK*) and subsequently converted to *Sec* by the enzyme *O-phosphoseryl-selenocysteyl synthase* (*SepSecS*), which uses *selenophosphate* as a selenium donor. In bacteria, this intermediate phosphorylation step does not occur, and the conversion to *Sec* is catalyzed directly by *selenocysteine synthase* (*SelA*) [9,11].

### *Mechanism of Sec Insertion During Translation*

The insertion of *Sec* during translation depends on an unusual mechanism. *tRNASec* has the anticodon *UCA*, which is complementary to the *UGA codon*, a sequence that normally serves as a *termination signal* [8]. In mRNAs that encode *selenoproteins*, a cis-motif called *SECIS* (*Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence*) allows the *UGA codon* to be reinterpreted as *Sec*. This process involves specialized elongation factors: *SelB* in bacteria and *eEFSec* in eukaryotes/archaea, which recognize the charged *tRNASec* and interact with the *SECIS*. In bacteria, this element is found in the coding region immediately after the *UGA codon*, enabling direct binding of *SelB*. In eukaryotes, however, the *SECIS* is located in the *3‚Ä≤UTR*, so the interaction requires the *SBP2 cofactor* to recruit *tRNASec* to the ribosome [8,9,11]. This re-coding of a stop codon to direct the incorporation of *Sec* ensures the synthesis of *selenoproteins*, which are essential for *redox homeostasis* and various metabolic processes (Figure 4) [12].

### Key Structural Features of tRNASec

Structurally, *tRNASec* is the *longest known tRNA*, with approximately *90‚Äì101 nucleotides*, compared to the typical ~75 nucleotides of canonical tRNAs.
Compose by
* **Acceptor-TŒ®C Stem**: This stem is significantly longer, reaching *13 base pairs* (bp), which is much more than the typical 12 bp in standard tRNAs. This is distributed as a 9/4 configuration in eukaryotes and archaea, or 8/5 in bacteria.
* **D Arm**: It has an extended D arm of *6‚Äì7 bp* with a reduced loop of ~4 nucleotides.
* **Variable Arm**: This arm is exceptionally long, forming a *stem-loop* of about *16 nucleotides* in eukaryotes.

These structural peculiarities prevent the formation of the *compact tertiary core* found in conventional tRNAs. Instead, they create an *open cavity*, which provides *structural flexibility* [14]. A highly conserved *guanine at position 73 (G73)* acts as a key *discriminating base* for recognition by the enzymes in the selenocysteine pathway [12,15].
